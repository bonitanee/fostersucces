				<p class="questions" ><bold>Question :</bold>    Our foster daughter has only been with us for two weeks, and I thought things were going well - we were starting to gain trust. But the other day when I thought we had a bonding moment, I went for a hug and she completely overreacted and started yelling and saying I shouldn't 'touch her like that'. I was completely taken off-guard by this and didn't mean to overstep any boundaries - I'm not sure how to react.</p>
				<p class="answers"><bold>Answer :</bold>    Do you know the full background history of your foster daughter? It sounds like there could be a history of some sort of physical or even sexual abuse. Trauma or fear sometimes show up as anger or behaviour that seems out of proportion to the situation at hand. Your child may  have associated the hug as a repeat of adult behaviour they have experienced before, which might lead to allegations of inappropriate behaviour or sexual abuse.</p>
